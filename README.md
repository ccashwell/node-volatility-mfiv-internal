## Overview

This nodejs project is intended to be used to compute MFIV (model-free implied volatility) from [deribit](deribit.com) options data provided by [tardis-dev](https://github.com/tardis-dev/tardis-node) and then written to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) by [volatility.com](https://volatility.com). To learn more about the MFIV data written to IPFS see below.

## Getting Started

```
$ git clone https://github.com/VolatilityGroup/node-volatility-mfiv.git
$ cd node-volatility-mfiv
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm test
$ npm run example
```

In the terminal you should see the following:

```
ðŸš€ check eth-mfiv-14d-2021-10-01T07:02:00.000Z
âœ… File valid.
```

## IPFS JSON Schema

See [mfiv schema](./schemas/mfivexample.schema.json)

## Getting IPFS Data

There are two ways you can easily access the IPFS data:

1. Programatically Create IPFS JSON file.
2. Access the IPFS data via a URL and download the data as a JSON.

Currently, IPFS is being written every 5 minutes on the hour so you MUST enter a time in 5-minute increments UTC (e.g. "07:00", "07:05", "07:10", etc.). Otherwise, you will get a file not found error, or you will generate a URL that gives a 404.

**Programatically Create IPFS JSON file**

This bash script has a dependency of `jq` for pretty printing but feel free to modify on your local machine if it's not needed.

```
#
# Usage: fetch_fleek 2021-01-25 03:30:00
# Timestamps are always in GMT
# Requires 'jq' to be installed -- "brew install jq" (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
#
fetch_fleek() {
    local timestamp=$(date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z" "$1 $2 GMT" +%s000)
    set -o pipefail # Set pipefail option so if curl fails the script will stop
    if ! curl --silent -L "https://storageapi.fleek.co/volatilitycom-bucket/indices/methodology=mfiv/interval=14d/currency=ETH/at=$timestamp/evidence.json" | jq .; then
        echo "Command exited with code $?"
    fi
    set +o pipefail
}
```

Here's an example of fetching data and writing it to a file:

```
$ fetch_fleek 2022-01-25 03:30:00 2>&1 | tee ipfs.json 
```

**Programatically Create URL**

The following script will make a header request to `fleek` to get the IPFS hash returned in the `etag` header value and won't actually download anything. Instead, it constructs the URL for IPFS.

```
#
# Requires 'jq' to be installed -- "brew install jq" (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
#
fetch_ipfs() {
    local timestamp=$(date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z" "$1 $2 GMT" +%s000)
    set -o pipefail # Set pipefail option so if curl fails the script will stop
    if ! curl -L -sI "https://storageapi.fleek.co/volatilitycom-bucket/indices/methodology=mfiv/interval=14d/currency=ETH/at=$timestamp/evidence.json" | tr -d '\r' | awk 'BEGIN {FS=": "}/^etag/{printf $2}' | tr -d '"' | awk '{printf "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/%s\n", $1}'; then
        echo "Command exited with code $?"
    fi
    set +o pipefail
}
```

Here's an example of fetching the URL:

```
$ fetch_ipfs 2022-01-25 03:30:00
```

Here's an example output URL. Notice it uses the IPFShash.

```
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeidhr2gcvozyznhabmubgmuwupzxvcetyfkpn5r7kvsq5alblrrlhi
```

**Manually Create URL**

If you have the `<IPFShash>` you can simply create the url with the following:

`http://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/<IPFShash>`

Or you can download the data by:

`$ Curl https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<IPFShash>`

If you do not have the `<IPFShash>` you can create the URL with the following URL by changing `$timestamp`:

`https://storageapi.fleek.co/volatilitycom-bucket/indices/methodology=mfiv/interval=14d/currency=ETH/at=$timestamp/evidence.json`

Where

- `$timestamp` - is written as the date/time in MS (ISO8106). You can use this free tool to convert a UTC date/time to the proper format: [https://currentmillis.com/](https://currentmillis.com/).

Here's an example URL for 2022-01-25 03:30:00 GMT:

```
https://storageapi.fleek.co/volatilitycom-bucket/indices/methodology=mfiv/interval=14d/currency=ETH/at=1643081400000/evidence.json
```

## Verifying an Index

The open-source code in this repo will ingest the ipfs.json input data and verify that the outputs are the same.

1. Place the `ipfs.json` file in this directory. If you downloaded using a URL you can rename the hash or timestamp as ipfs.
2. `./bin/volatility.mjs -f ipfs.json`

In the terminal you should see the following:

```
ðŸš€ check example/ipfs.json
âœ… File valid.
```

As well as the index value.
